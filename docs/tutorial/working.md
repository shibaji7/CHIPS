# How CHIPS Works? Unveiling the Intricacies of CHIPS Algorithm: A Step-by-Step Guide with a Case Study
We delve into the intricacies of the **CHIPS** algorithm, offering a comprehensive guide alongside an illustrative example using images captured on 30 May 2018. Despite the array of semi-automatic and automatic schemes available for Coronal Hole Boundary (CHB) detection [e.g.,@Krista2009]~\cite[e.g.][]{Krista2009,Garton2018,Illarionov2018}, CHIPS stands out due to its unique selling proposition.

What sets CHIPS apart is its ability to provide a \textbf{probability [$\theta$]} for the identified Coronal Hole (CH) and its associated CHB. This distinctive feature equips researchers with a quantifiable measure of certainty regarding the detection mechanism. Join us as we navigate through the sequential steps of the CHIPS algorithm, gaining insights into its functionality and the invaluable certainty it brings to CH and CHB identification.

Stay tuned for a captivating journey into the heart of CHIPS, unraveling its potential in solar research and space weather forecasting.
